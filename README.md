## 📈 Mutual Fund Strategy using Python

A data-driven approach to building a low-risk, high-return mutual fund plan using historical Nifty50 stock data. This project analyzes returns and volatility, selects optimal stocks, allocates weights, and forecasts investment growth.

## 📊 Project Overview

Mutual funds aim to offer balanced returns by investing in a variety of stocks. But how do you pick the right stocks and allocation? In this project, I:

Pulled and cleaned historical stock price data

Calculated Return on Investment (ROI) and volatility

Selected stocks with high ROI and low volatility

Allocated investments using inverse volatility weighting

Forecasted future values of monthly investments

Visualized performance comparisons

## 💡 Motivation

This project is inspired by real investment discussions I engage in as an Executive Assistant to a company Co-founder. I wanted to understand how data can guide financial strategy and investment allocation, and apply it using my data science skills.

## 🔧 Tools & Libraries

Python 🐍

Pandas, NumPy

Plotly for interactive graphs

Financial logic: ROI, volatility, CAGR
